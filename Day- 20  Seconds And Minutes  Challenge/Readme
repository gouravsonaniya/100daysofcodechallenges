In this challenge, we're going to create a method, that takes time, represented in seconds,as the parameter.
We'll then want to transform the seconds into hours.
Next we'll display the time in hours, with the remaining minutes and seconds, in a String.
we'll do this transformation in two steps,which allows us to overloaded methods.
